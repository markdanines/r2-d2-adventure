## R2-D2 Exercise

## Startup
To start this application, navigate to the root folder in the terminal and run either "npm start" which will install all dependencies and start the application at the same time or you can do it manually by typing "npm install" to install the dependencies and then running the application by entering "node app".

## Challenges
Overall, implementing this application was great, but it did come with some challenges of its own. Finding the right npm packages was one of them. I only downloaded 2, but had to figure out which would be the best fit for the application and something that was reliable as well. Another thing that was a challenge was trying organize the code, and separating the logic out into various files that make sense.
